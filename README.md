Made a simple Connect4 game! 

## My third app!
Your favorite app developer decided to sit down over a weekend and create this simple game. What I really wanted to focus on was creating a simple yet beautiful user interface, while also finding the most efficient ways to check for four-in-a-row.



## Features:

• Has a randomized computer opponent

• Great user interface and user experience

• Displays wins during current app session

• Has a very efficient win checking a win (4 in a row) 



## Takeaways:

• Created a large portion of this application without the storyboard editor, instead we focused on creating almost all the UIImageViews, UIButtons, and UIStackViews programmatically

• Implemented distinguishing Swift files that differentiated between the frontend and backend of the game

• The chip drop animation was harder to implement than it seems!



## So what's the point of this?

• Learning more about Swift and the app development process.

• Focus on creating the application as programmatically as possible in order to better understand UIKit and Swift objects

• Focus on creating a very efficient [win checking ability](https://github.com/thearijain/MixIt/blob/master/ReadMePictures/isWin()%20(2).pdf).
